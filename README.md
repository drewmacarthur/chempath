~ Welcome to chempath ~

Featuring code from any projects I have been working on in the Chemical Pathology department at UP/NHLS, 
including tools and concepts relevant to routine clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine. 

Languages: R and Python

IDE used: Primarily RStudio and Spyder

Projects in this repository:

- Indirect reference interval (RI) determination for routine laboratory data (e.g. HbA1c)
- Tutorial on RI analysis using RefineR and ReflimR
- Quantile regression analysis
- Biological variation-based reference intervals
- Seasonal variation analysis of routine laboratory data

For those new to R, you can download and install it here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

You will need RStudio, an interactive coding environment to perform analyses: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Download the desired .R script file and open it in RStudio to get started on your own analysis.
